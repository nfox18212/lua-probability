## lua-probability
A lua library to do common probability functions.

Library is a work in process, and I will add more functions to it as time goes on.  Currently it will do factorials, cominbations, and probability without replacement.  More features will be added later.

## TODO:
# List is sorted in terms of priority
- Add permutations
- Add probability with replacement
- Conditional Probability
- Total probability
- Bayes formula

# Will do eventually, maybe
- Discrete Random Variables
- Distribution functions
- Probability mass functions
